1. Ternary Operator
   1. Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2
   2. Condition: Boolean expression, evaluates to true or false.
   3. Expressions: Both expressions must return compatible types.
   4. Use Case: Suitable for simple conditional assignments.
2. Switch
   1. Multiple Cases: Handles multiple values for an
      expression efficiently.
   2. Supported Types: Accepts byte, short, char, int, String,
      enums, and from Java 14, long, float, double.
   3. Case Labels: Each case ends with a colon (:) and is
      followed by code.
   4. Break Statement: Typically used to prevent fall-through
      between cases.
3. CHALLENGE
